current keyed diffing does NOT do yet:
It matches old and new children by key to update, add, or remove items.

But it does NOT move the actual DOM elements around if their order changes.

Instead, your current code updates children at their current indices and removes extra old nodes.

This means if the order changes, the rendered DOM nodes will stay in the old order (or get replaced), causing visual glitches or unexpected behavior.


---
Your keyed diffing handles adding/removing items smartly and updates matching items.

But if you reorder the list items, your DOM wonâ€™t reorder properly yet.

The DOM will keep the old order or replace nodes unnecessarily.
