1  issue on db click + issue one blue 

what was the problem ?

In original EventRegistry:
document.onblur = (e) => self.dispatch("blur", e);
Issue: blur (and also change) do not bubble up the DOM.
dispatch method walks up the DOM from event.target to document.
Because blur never reaches document, handler never fires.
So the main problem was:
Non-bubbling events cannot be attached to document 


how i solve it 
I created a new helper method:
attachNonBubbling(type) {
  const elements = document.querySelectorAll(`[data-on${type}]`);
  elements.forEach(el => {
    el.addEventListener(type, (e) => this.dispatch(type, e));
  });
}
then in init 

this.attachNonBubbling("change");
this.attachNonBubbling("blur");

🔹 What happens on a blur (non-bubbling event)
You click away from an input (it loses focus).
The event only triggers on that input.
It does NOT bubble up to parent elements or document.

| Event Type | Bubbling? | Where to attach    |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| click      | ✅ yes     | parent or document |
| dblclick   | ✅ yes     | parent or document |
| keydown    | ✅ yes     | parent or document |
| scroll     | ✅ yes     | parent or document |
| input      | ✅ yes     | parent or document |
| change     | ❌ no      | element itself     |
| blur       | ❌ no      | element itself     |


bubbles up to its parent (div) → then body → then html → finally document.
Bubbling: the event spreads upward like water in a fountain.
Non-bubbling: the event stays in the cup where it started — you have to catch it there.
